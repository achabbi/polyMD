# polyMD: GROMACS MD Simulation Pipeline

Moleculer dynamics pipeline for running high-throughput simulations on cleavable-bond modified polyethylene. Designed for SLURM-based computing clusters. This uses the [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) MD simulation software with the OPLS united-atom forcefield.

## Setup

1. Clone repository.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/achabbi/polyMD.git
$ cd polyMD/
```

2. Create conda environment.

```sh
$ module load python
$ conda env create --prefix=/path/to/new/environment -f environment.yml
$ source activate polyMD
```

## Usage

### Running Simulations

To setup and submit simulation jobs, edit the parameters in [`setup_runs.sh`](polyply/setup_runs.sh) and [`submit.sh`](polyply/submit.sh) to be the same, then run both scripts.

- Select/edit either [`SBATCH_MIDWAY3`](SBATCH_TEMPLATES/SBATCH_MIDWAY3) or [`SBATCH_MIDWAY2`](SBATCH_TEMPLATES/SBATCH_MIDWAY2) files from [`SBATCH_TEMPLATES/`](SBATCH_TEMPLATES/)
- Set `sbatch_type="SBATCH_MIDWAY3"` or `sbatch_type="SBATCH_MIDWAY2"` in both shell scripts

```sh
cd polyply/
bash setup_runs.sh
bash submit.sh
```

### Running Analysis

To setup and submit analysis jobs on simulation trajectories, edit the parameters in [`setup_analysis.sh`](polyply/setup_analysis.sh) and [`submit.sh`](polyply/submit.sh) to be the same, then run both scripts.

- Edit [`SBATCH_ANALYSIS`](SBATCH_TEMPLATES/SBATCH_ANLAYSIS) from [`SBATCH_TEMPLATES/`](SBATCH_TEMPLATES/)
- Set `sbatch_type="SBATCH_ANALYSIS"` in both shell scripts

```sh
cd polyply/
bash setup_analysis.sh
bash submit.sh
```

Run [`compile.py`](compile.py) to compile results into a single csv for the desired molecule. If the csv file already exists in [`csv_files/`](csv_files/), it will be updated with the new data. Otherwise, a new csv file will be created.

```sh
# Running for ester group (EST)
python compile.py -c EST
```
